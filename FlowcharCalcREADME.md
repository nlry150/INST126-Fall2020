# Flowchart Calculator Project
## Overview of the calculator's functionality

This calculator I made from scratch is a easy to use, **5-operation** calculator which allows you to do very basic computations.
The point of this calculator was to see if INST126 students are able to make their own working calculator program based off
comprehension of a flow-chart.

As stated previously, this calculator is a **5**-operation calculator which allows you to do *additon, subtraction, multiplication, division and calculating a number by the powers of "x".


### Running the code

As you run the calculator, it will ask you to select the kind of math operation you choose to perform.

The operations are listed 1-5.
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Power

Simply enter the number that corresponds to the math operation you choose to perform in the text box and the calculator will
perform.

After entering the math operation of choice, the program will proceed to ask you to enter the first number and the second number
of operation.

After entering the second number and pressing enter, your math problem will be solved instantly and accurately.

After your problem is solved, the program will ask if you would like to perform another calculation. To continue using the calculator you can type in "Y" or "y" for YES and the program will continue. If not, you can type in "N" or "n" for NO and the program will give you a pleasant thank you message for using this INST126 calculator program project.

Thank you for reading this "how to" document and have fun calculating!
